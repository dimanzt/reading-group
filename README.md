# Reading Group

This repository contains practical information for the 
reading group organized by students 
in the school of EECS at Penn State. 

## Location and time

* Location: TBD
* Time: TBD

## Contact information

You can ask to join the mailing list 
[here](https://groups.google.com/group/psu-eecs-reading-group).

## How the reading group works

The group meets once per week for 30mn to discuss papers selected. 
Anyone part of the reading group can submit papers by sending its 
abstract along with a link to the 
[mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/psu-eecs-reading-group). 
During the 30mn meeting, someone briefly talks for 3-5mn about each 
paper selected and then we move on to the next paper. Attendees 
are NOT expected to prepare slides, this is more of an informal 
discussion designed to help you discover papers that you should 
spend reading time on.

## Archive of papers presented

These links point to lists of abstracts for the papers that were 
presented in the reading group.

* Week of TBD: *link will be added soon*
